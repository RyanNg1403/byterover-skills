## Memory Extraction Guidelines

When aggregating memories into a PRD:

1. **Identify the core feature** from memory queries
2. **Extract user needs** from problem/discussion memories
3. **Gather requirements** from technical discussions and decisions
4. **Find acceptance criteria** from testing/validation memories
5. **Collect technical details** from implementation discussions
6. **Identify risks** from challenge/blocker memories
7. **Extract metrics** from goals/success criteria memories

## Prioritization from Memories

When determining requirement priority:
- **P0 (Must Have)**: Explicitly marked as critical, required for MVP, blocking
- **P1 (Should Have)**: Important but not blocking, mentioned as next priority
- **P2 (Nice to Have)**: Future enhancements, mentioned as "later" or "if time"

## Example Property Schema (if creating in database)

```javascript
{
  "Title": "Real-time Collaboration Feature",
  "Type": "PRD",
  "Status": "In Review",
  "Owner": ["product-manager-id"],
  "Priority": "P0",
  "Target Release": "2025-Q3",
  "Tags": ["collaboration", "real-time", "core-feature"],
  "Epic": "Collaboration Suite"
}
```

## Tips for PRD Quality

1. **Be specific**: Use concrete examples from memories
2. **Quantify metrics**: Extract specific numbers when available
3. **Clarify assumptions**: Note what's inferred vs. explicit
4. **Highlight gaps**: Note missing information as open questions
5. **Link related work**: Connect to other relevant Notion pages
6. **Keep updated**: Mark as living document that can be refined
