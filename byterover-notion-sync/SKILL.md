# Byterover Notion Sync

Bidirectional knowledge synchronization between Byterover memories and Notion documentation. Converts agent-readable memories into team-digestible documentation (reports, PRDs, architecture docs) and imports structured Notion content back into searchable memories.

## Core Capabilities

This skill provides two primary directions for knowledge flow:

### 1. Memories â†’ Notion Documentation
Transform Byterover memories into structured, human-readable documentation in Notion:
- Implementation reports with timelines
- Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)
- Feature documentation
- Technical architecture documentation

### 2. Notion â†’ Byterover Memories
Convert Notion pages into searchable, agent-optimized memories:
- Break down documentation into logical chunks
- Preserve structure and context
- Handle nested pages recursively
- Maintain traceability to source

---

## Workflow Decision Tree

**When user requests documentation creation**, use this decision tree:

```
Is the user asking to:

1. Create/Generate documentation in Notion FROM memories?
   â†’ Go to: Memories to Notion Workflow

2. Import/Convert Notion pages TO memories?
   â†’ Go to: Notion to Memories Workflow

3. Unclear which direction?
   â†’ Ask: "Would you like to:
      A) Create Notion documentation from your Byterover memories
      B) Import Notion content into Byterover memories"
```

---

## Memories to Notion Workflow

Convert Byterover memories into structured Notion documentation.

### Step 1: Understand Request

**Extract from user query**:
- Topic/task name for memory search
- Timeline (if provided): e.g., "July 10-15" or "last week"
- Desired format: implementation report, PRD, feature docs, architecture docs
- Notion destination (if specified): page URL, database, or workspace-level

**If format not specified**, use the [Format Selection Guide](references/format-selection-guide.md) to determine appropriate format based on content characteristics.

### Step 2: Retrieve Relevant Memories

Call `Byterover:byterover-retrieve-knowledge` **multiple times** (3-5 calls) with variations:

```
Example for "authentication implementation July 10-15":
- Query 1: "authentication implementation July 2025"
- Query 2: "JWT token user login July"
- Query 3: "authentication security decisions"
- Query 4: "user authentication challenges errors"
- Query 5: "auth deployment July 15"
```

**Important**: Aggregate results from multiple queries to get comprehensive context.

### Step 3: Select Documentation Format

Based on content analysis and user request, choose format:

**Implementation Report** â†’ [references/implementation-report-format.md](references/implementation-report-format.md)
- Use when: Describing completed work with timeline
- Indicators: Past tense, temporal progression, challenges & solutions

**PRD** â†’ [references/prd-format.md](references/prd-format.md)
- Use when: Planning features, defining requirements
- Indicators: Future tense, user stories, acceptance criteria

**Feature Documentation** â†’ [references/feature-documentation-format.md](references/feature-documentation-format.md)
- Use when: Explaining how to use something
- Indicators: Usage instructions, code examples, troubleshooting

**Technical Architecture** â†’ [references/technical-architecture-format.md](references/technical-architecture-format.md)
- Use when: System design, component interactions
- Indicators: Architecture diagrams, design decisions, infrastructure

See [references/format-selection-guide.md](references/format-selection-guide.md) for detailed selection criteria.

### Step 4: Structure Content

Follow the selected format template:

1. **Extract information** from aggregated memories
2. **Organize chronologically** (for reports) or logically (for other formats)
3. **Fill template sections** with relevant content from memories
4. **Add context** where memories are sparse
5. **Create timeline** by identifying temporal markers in memories
6. **Note gaps** as open questions or areas for clarification

### Step 5: Determine Notion Destination

**User specified destination**:
- Page URL â†’ Use `Notion:notion-create-pages` with `page_id` parent
- Database URL â†’ First use `Notion:notion-fetch` to get data source, then use `data_source_id` parent
- Teamspace â†’ Use `Notion:notion-create-pages` with `teamspace_id`

**User did not specify**:
- Ask: "Where would you like to save this in Notion?" with options:
  - Create as standalone page (can be organized later)
  - Specify a parent page or database
  - Save to a specific teamspace

**Default**: Create as standalone workspace-level page if user prefers not to specify.

### Step 6: Create Notion Page

Use `Notion:notion-create-pages`:

```javascript
{
  "parent": {
    "page_id": "..." // or data_source_id or omit for workspace-level
  },
  "pages": [{
    "properties": {
      "title": "[Document Title]",
      // Add other properties if creating in database
    },
    "content": "[Structured markdown content from template]"
  }]
}
```

**For databases**, include appropriate properties based on format:
- Implementation Report: Type, Status, Start Date, End Date, Team, Tags
- PRD: Type, Status, Owner, Priority, Target Release, Tags
- Feature Documentation: Type, Status, Category, Tags, Last Updated
- Technical Architecture: Type, Status, System, Owner, Version

### Step 7: Confirm and Provide Link

Return to user:
- Link to created Notion page
- Summary of what was documented
- Note any gaps or areas that need manual review
- Suggest follow-up actions if relevant

**Example response**:
```
Created Implementation Report: "User Authentication Implementation"

ðŸ“„ Notion page: https://notion.so/...

Summary:
- Documented 5-day implementation timeline (July 10-15)
- Captured 3 major technical decisions
- Included challenges and resolutions
- Added 8 code examples from memories

Note: Timeline dates were approximate based on memory context. You may want to verify exact dates.
```

## Notion to Memories Workflow

Convert Notion pages into Byterover memories while preserving structure.

### Step 1: Understand Request

**Extract from user query**:
- Notion page URL or search query
- Topic/area (if searching rather than direct URL)
- Scope: single page or include nested pages
- Any special focus areas

### Step 2: Locate Notion Content

**If user provided URL**:
- Use `Notion:notion-fetch` with the page URL/ID

**If user provided topic/search query**:
- Use `Notion:notion-search` to find relevant pages
- Present results to user for confirmation
- Fetch confirmed pages

### Step 3: Analyze Page Structure

Review fetched content for:
- Main sections (## headings)
- Nested/child pages (<page> tags)
- Content types: concepts, procedures, code, decisions, APIs
- Total length and complexity

### Step 4: Plan Memory Chunks

Follow [references/notion-to-memory-guide.md](references/notion-to-memory-guide.md) chunking strategy:

**Create separate memories for**:
- Each major section with substantial content (>100 words)
- Distinct concepts or topics
- Code examples with explanations
- Procedures or workflows
- Decision records
- API endpoints or methods

**Memory size guidelines**:
- Ideal: 200-800 words
- Minimum: 100 words (combine smaller sections)
- Maximum: 1500 words (split larger sections)

### Step 5: Extract and Format Memories

For each planned chunk:

1. **Extract content** with surrounding context
2. **Format based on content type**:
   - Concept/Definition
   - Procedure/How-To
   - Code Example
   - Decision/ADR
   - API/Reference
   - Architectural Component

   See [references/notion-to-memory-guide.md](references/notion-to-memory-guide.md) for templates.

3. **Add metadata**:
   ```markdown
   **Source**: [Page Title] - [Section Name]
   **Topic**: [Main topic]
   [Content formatted according to type]
   **Notion Source**: [Page URL]
   ```

4. **Store memory** using `Byterover:byterover-store-knowledge`

### Step 6: Handle Nested Pages

For each child page found in <page> tags:

1. **Fetch child page** using `Notion:notion-fetch`
2. **Add parent context** to memories from child page
3. **Repeat conversion process** (Steps 3-5)
4. **Create relationship memory** linking parent and child topics if needed

### Step 7: Verify and Summarize

**Quality checks** before finalizing:
- [ ] All major sections converted to memories
- [ ] Code examples are complete and formatted
- [ ] Source URLs are included
- [ ] Context is preserved
- [ ] Memory sizes are reasonable

**Return to user**:
- Count of memories created
- Summary of topics covered
- Any sections skipped or combined
- Confirmation of nested page processing

**Example response**:
```
Converted Notion page to memories: "API Authentication Guide"

âœ… Created 8 memories:
   - 1 overview memory
   - 3 procedure memories (getting token, using token, refreshing)
   - 2 code example memories
   - 1 troubleshooting memory
   - 1 API reference memory

Processed 2 nested pages:
   - "JWT Token Implementation"
   - "OAuth2 Integration"

Total: 8 parent page memories + 12 nested page memories = 20 memories

All memories include source URLs for traceability.
```

## Best Practices

### For Memories â†’ Notion

1. **Cast wide net**: Use multiple memory queries with variations
2. **Aggregate first**: Collect all relevant memories before structuring
3. **Choose format carefully**: Use format selection guide
4. **Preserve technical accuracy**: Don't paraphrase code or technical terms
5. **Note gaps**: Mark unclear areas as open questions
6. **Add timeline context**: Extract dates and temporal markers from memories
7. **Link related docs**: Cross-reference other relevant Notion pages

### For Notion â†’ Memories

1. **Chunk logically**: Keep related information together
2. **Preserve structure**: Maintain headings, lists, code formatting
3. **Add context**: Include source page and section information
4. **Handle nesting**: Process child pages recursively
5. **Don't over-split**: Avoid creating too many tiny memories
6. **Test retrieval**: Consider what queries would find these memories
7. **Maintain traceability**: Always include source URLs

### General Guidelines

1. **Bidirectional traceability**: Always link between Notion and memories
2. **Preserve technical detail**: Don't lose code, configurations, or specifics
3. **Structure consistently**: Use templates for reproducibility
4. **Focus on reusability**: Format for future discovery and use
5. **Handle conflicts**: If memory conflicts detected, show resolution URL to user
6. **Iterate**: Ask for user feedback and refine as needed

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Insufficient Memories Retrieved

**Solution**:
- Try broader query terms
- Use multiple variations of query
- Adjust time range if applicable
- Ask user to provide more specific topic details

### Issue: Can't Determine Format

**Solution**:
- Ask user directly: "Would you like this as an implementation report, PRD, feature documentation, or architecture document?"
- If still unclear, default to Implementation Report (most general)

### Issue: Timeline Information Missing

**Solution**:
- Note in document: "Timeline approximate based on memory context"
- Use relative markers: "early phase", "later", "final stages"
- Leave specific dates as [TBD] and note for user to fill in

### Issue: Memory Conflicts Detected

**Solution**:
- **CRITICAL**: Always display conflict resolution URL to user
- Explain conflict briefly
- Provide link for resolution
- Wait for user to resolve before continuing

### Issue: Large Notion Page (>5000 words)

**Solution**:
- Break into multiple memories strategically
- Use nested sections as natural boundaries
- Create index memory linking to sub-memories
- Process in batches if needed
