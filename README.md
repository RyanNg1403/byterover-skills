# Byterover Skills

A collection of specialized Claude Code skills for working with the [Byterover MCP Server](https://github.com/ngalvare/byterover-mcp). These skills extend Byterover's memory and knowledge management capabilities with structured workflows, advanced documentation features, and seamless integrations.

## What are Byterover Skills?

Byterover is a powerful memory system for AI agents, allowing them to store and retrieve knowledge across conversations. These skills build on top of Byterover's foundation to provide:

- **Structured workflows** for common documentation tasks
- **Bidirectional integrations** with tools like Notion
- **Specialized formats** for reports, PRDs, architecture docs, and more
- **Best practices** for knowledge capture and retrieval

## Available Skills

### üîÑ byterover-notion-sync

**Bidirectional knowledge synchronization between Byterover memories and Notion documentation.**

**Use when you need to**:
- Convert Byterover memories into structured Notion documentation (implementation reports, PRDs, feature docs, architecture docs)
- Import Notion pages into searchable Byterover memories
- Create timelines and reports from development memories
- Document features and architectures based on implementation knowledge

**Key capabilities**:
- **4 Documentation Formats**: Implementation reports with timelines, PRDs, feature documentation, technical architecture docs
- **Smart format selection**: Automatically determines appropriate format based on content
- **Multi-query retrieval**: Intelligently queries memories multiple times with variations for comprehensive context
- **Logical chunking**: Breaks Notion content into optimal memory sizes (200-800 words)
- **Structure preservation**: Maintains code blocks, tables, headings, and nested pages
- **Bidirectional traceability**: Links between Notion pages and Byterover memories

**Example use cases**:
```
"Create an implementation report on the authentication system from July 10-15"
"Turn our notification system discussions into a PRD"
"Document the microservices architecture"
"Import the API documentation from Notion into memories"
```

## Usage

### Quick Start

Once installed, skills are automatically invoked based on your requests. No special commands needed!

**Example workflows**:

```
# Memories ‚Üí Notion Documentation
User: "Create an implementation report on the payment system we built last week"
‚Üí Claude uses byterover-notion-sync to:
  1. Query memories about payment system
  2. Structure as implementation report
  3. Create Notion page with timeline

# Notion ‚Üí Byterover Memories
User: "Import our API documentation from Notion into memories"
‚Üí Claude uses byterover-notion-sync to:
  1. Fetch Notion page
  2. Break into logical chunks
  3. Store as searchable memories

# Architecture Documentation
User: "Document our microservices architecture based on recent work"
‚Üí Claude uses byterover-notion-sync to:
  1. Retrieve architecture-related memories
  2. Structure as technical architecture doc
  3. Include diagrams and design decisions
```

### Skill-Specific Documentation

Each skill includes detailed documentation in its folder:
